# java-capstone-two
This is the second Java Capstone Project i did for the HyperionDev Bootcamp. <br />
It takes the first Java Capstone and refactors it so that in incorporates exception handling. <br />
It also improves the readability of the code by making sure the indentation and variable naming is correct.
